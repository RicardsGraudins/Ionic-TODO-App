# Ionic-TODO-App
This repository contains code for my second-year undergraduate project for the module **Mobile Applications Developement.** The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/).

#### Overview:
This application was created using Cordova and [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) for android devices running any 4.x version. This version of android is no longer used and as such the application may no longer function as intended thus I recommend rebuilding the APK file for the current version of android before using the application.
An enchanced Windows application that is similar in functionality can be viewed in my other repository [here](https://github.com/RicardsGraudins/Do-Diddly).
